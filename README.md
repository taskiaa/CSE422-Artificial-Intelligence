Hotel review analysis and classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches
#NLP #ML #DL #Dataanalysis





This project developed a hotel recommendation system that uses sentiment analysis on user-generated reviews to suggest accommodations. The system analyzes both positive and negative feedback from multilingual datasets using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models.

 Key Features:
Dataset: 515,000+ hotel reviews from Booking.com (Kaggle dataset).

Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization (using SpaCy), and vectorization.

Feature Extraction: Used CountVectorizer and GloVe for word embeddings.

Models Used:

Machine Learning: KNN, MNB, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, AdaBoost, MLP.

Deep Learning: Attention-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, RNN-LSTM (Best Accuracy: 96.02%).

Best Performing Model: RNN-LSTM (F1 Score: Positive 97%, Negative 91%, Accuracy: 96.02%).

Application: Helps travelers make better decisions based on sentiment trends in multilingual hotel reviews.

 Future Scope:
Introduce cross-lingual learning for better multilingual performance.

Integrate BERT for deeper contextual understanding of sentiments.
